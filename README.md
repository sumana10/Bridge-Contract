# Cross-Chain Token Bridge

A decentralized bridge enabling token transfers between BNB Chain Testnet and Polygon Amoy Testnet. Tokens are locked on the source chain and minted on the destination chain to ensure secure and consistent transfers.

The system includes smart contracts on both chains, a WebSocket listener for blockchain events, a queue for handling cross-chain transactions, and a frontend for user interaction. It ensures safety through nonce tracking and token whitelisting, offering a reliable bridge experience end to end.
